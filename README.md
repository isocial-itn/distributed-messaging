distributed-messaging
=====================

A light-weight Rest-ful API for decentralized messaging built with node.js and mongodb.

The implementation aims to provide high performance by using three communication channels: UDP for notifications, HTTP for JSON data exchange and WebSockets for realt-time HTTP push.

The implementation is tested on a Raspberry PI model B. This hardware is used for perfomance and scalability evaluation.
